#summary How to transform image with Zend_Image?

= Introduction =
First, you need to load image:
{{{
$transform = new Zend_Image_Transform( 'worms.jpg', new Zend_Image_Driver_Gd );
}}}

Or, you can use this syntax (usable sometimes):
{{{
$image = new Zend_Image( 'worms.jpg', new Zend_Image_Driver_Gd );
$transform = new Zend_Image_Transform( $image );
}}}

= Resizing =
You can resize image as you wish with following method:
`Zend_Image_Transform::resize( $newWidth, $newHeight );`

Example ($image was created earlier):
{{{
$transform->resize( 100, 200 );
}}}

= Cropping =
`Zend_Image_Transform::crop( $newWidth, $newHeight );`

By default, this api crop from top left corner of source image. How to fix it, we show later.

This example shows, how to crop a 50x50 area from source image (source _must be_ greater, than 50x50): 
{{{
$transform->crop( 50, 50 );
}}}
