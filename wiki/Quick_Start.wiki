= Download =
You can download latest release of Zend_Image from [http://example.com urlhere].

= Installation =
Zend_Image doesn't use any of Zend Framework classes, so you can simply copy source
files into your project and start using it.

= Using =
== Basic usage ==
Simplest operation, that you can do with your image is a loading and getting
some image info, such as size. You can do it with this code:
{{{
$image = Zend_Image( 'fullmoon.jpg', new Zend_Image_Driver_Imagick );
echo 'Size: ' . $image->getWidth() . 'Ã—' . $image->getHeight();
}}}

Also, it's easy to make transformations:
{{{
$transformed = Zend_Image_Transform( $image );
$transformed->fitToWidth( 400 )->center()->middle()->crop( 50, 50 );
}}}

Printing text:
{{{
$texted = Zend_Image_Text( $image );
$texted->font( 'Verdana' )->size( 8 )->left( 10 )->top( 10 )->text( 'Uiiii!' );
}}}

Using overlays:
{{{
$overlayed = Zend_Image_Overlay( $image );
$overlayed->overlay( new Zend_Image( 'border.png' ) );
}}}

== Extended usage ==
You also can apply more than once filter at one command:
{{{
$image = new Zend_Image( 'ashes_and_snow.jpg', new Zend_Image_Driver_Imagick );
$image
    ->apply( new Zend_Image_Transform )->center()->crop( 0, -50 )
    ->apply( new Zend_Image_Color )->grayscale()
    ->apply( new Zend_Image_Text )
        ->bottom( 50 )->center()
        ->font( 'Arial' )->color( '#fff' )->background( '#000' )
        ->text( 'Fly the bird path' );
}}}
